# Docker Remote API

Docker's Remote API uses an open schema model.  In this model, unknown
properties in incoming messages are ignored. Client applications need to take
this behavior into account to ensure they do not break when talking to newer
Docker daemons.

The API tends to be REST, but for some complex commands, like attach or pull,
the HTTP connection is hijacked to transport STDOUT, STDIN, and STDERR.

By default the Docker daemon listens on `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` and the
client must have `root` access to interact with the daemon. If a group named
`docker` exists on your system, `docker` applies ownership of the socket to the
group.

To connect to the Docker daemon with cURL you need to use cURL 7.40 or
later, as these versions have the `--unix-socket` flag available. To
run `curl` against the daemon on the default socket, use the
following:

When using cUrl 7.50 or later:

```console
$ curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/json
```

When using cURL 7.40, `localhost` must be omitted:

```console
$ curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://containers/json
```

If you have bound the Docker daemon to a different socket path or TCP
port, you would reference that in your cURL rather than the
default.

The current version of the API is v1.25 which means calling `/info` is the same
as calling `/v1.25/info`. To call an older version of the API use
`/v1.24/info`. If a newer daemon is installed, new properties may be returned
even when calling older versions of the API.

Use the table below to find the API version for a Docker version:

Refer to the [GitHub repository](
https://github.com/docker/docker/tree/master/docs/reference/api) for
older releases.

## Authentication

Authentication configuration is handled client side, so the
client has to send the `authConfig` as a `POST` in `/images/(name)/push`. The
`authConfig`, set as the `X-Registry-Auth` header, is currently a Base64 encoded
(JSON) string with the following structure:

```JSON
{"username": "string", "password": "string", "email": "string",
   "serveraddress" : "string", "auth": ""}
```

Callers should leave the `auth` empty. The `serveraddress` is a domain/ip
without protocol. Throughout this structure, double quotes are required.

## Using Docker Machine with the API

If you are using `docker-machine`, the Docker daemon is on a host that
uses an encrypted TCP socket using TLS. This means, for Docker Machine users,
you need to add extra parameters to `curl` or `wget` when making test
API requests, for example:

```
curl --insecure \
     --cert $DOCKER_CERT_PATH/cert.pem \
     --key $DOCKER_CERT_PATH/key.pem \
     https://YOUR_VM_IP:2376/images/json

wget --no-check-certificate --certificate=$DOCKER_CERT_PATH/cert.pem \
     --private-key=$DOCKER_CERT_PATH/key.pem \
     https://YOUR_VM_IP:2376/images/json -O - -q
```

## Docker Events

The following diagram depicts the container states accessible through the API.

![States](images/event_state.png)

Some container-related events are not affected by container state, so they are not included in this diagram. These events are:

* **export** emitted by `docker export`
* **exec_create** emitted by `docker exec`
* **exec_start** emitted by `docker exec` after **exec_create**
* **detach** emitted when client is detached from container process
* **exec_detach** emitted when client is detached from exec process

Running `docker rmi` emits an **untag** event when removing an image name.  The `rmi` command may also emit **delete** events when images are deleted by ID directly or by deleting the last tag referring to the image.
